# News-Scanner
NNTP Group Scanner

This program I wrote will scan every newsgroup on your server for new 
articles. The first time you run it, it will list every newsgroup. After 
that run the program again with the argument 'clear'. The next time you 
run the program after that, it will list all of the newsgroups that have 
new posts. After you read all of the groups, run the program again with 
the clear argumenent, and it will reset to listing the newsgroups you 
haven't read. If you run the program without clear it will add new groups
to the list if there are any new ones.
